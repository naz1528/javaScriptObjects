Add/ Remove elements from array

arr.push() --> adds to the end of arr
arr.unshift() --> adds to the begining of arr
arr.pop() -->removes from the end of arr
arr.shift() --> removes from the begining of arr


Delete array elements:--
   
    Arrays are objects in javaScript so you can use delete method to delete items from an array. But as we delete elements with its indexes 
    hence the value is deleted but the index is still there so the length of array doesnt decrese which is fine when working with objects.
    
    var arr = ["i","am","a","teacher"]
    delete arr[1] //this would delete "am" from the array but the length will be 4 and accessing arr[1] would give undefined
    
    Hence, to avoid this use splice method. It adds, removes and inserts into an array.
    
    Syntax::  arr.splice(index,[deletecount, elem1, ... , elemn])
        index --> the index from where you want to do the operation
        deletecount --> number of elements to delete
        elem1 ... elemn --> elements to insert
        
        EXAMPLES::1 (delete array elem)
          var arr = ["i","am","a","teacher"]
          arr.splice(3,1) // ["i","am","a"]
          
          2: (Adding elements in the array ..)
          
           arr.splice(4,0,"yesss!!!")  //  ["i","am","a","teacher","yesss!!!"]
          
          3: (Adding elements in the indexed of removed elem)
          
           arr.splice(3,1,"magician")  //  ["i","am","a","teacher","yesss!!!"]
           
           
           Negative indexes allowed
Here and in other array methods, negative indexes are allowed. They specify the position from the end of the array, like here:

 let arr = [1, 2, 5];

// from index -1 (one step from the end)
// delete 0 elements,
// then insert 3 and 4
arr.splice(-1, 0, 3, 4);

alert( arr ); // 1,2,3,4,5


SLICE Method

It is simpler compared to splice and ait also returns a new array.
Syntax : arr.slice(start, end)

It works like str.splice, but makes subarrays instead of substrings.

For instance:

 let str = "test";
let arr = ["t", "e", "s", "t"];

alert( str.slice(1, 3) ); // es
alert( arr.slice(1, 3) ); // e,s

alert( str.slice(-2) ); // st
alert( arr.slice(-2) ); // s,t


concat
The method arr.concat joins the array with other arrays and/or items.

The syntax is:

arr.concat(arg1, arg2...)
It accepts any number of arguments – either arrays or values.

The result is a new array containing items from arr, then arg1, arg2 etc.

If an argument is an array or has Symbol.isConcatSpreadable property, then all its elements are copied. Otherwise, the argument itself is copied.

For instance:

 let arr = [1, 2];

// merge arr with [3,4]
alert( arr.concat([3, 4])); // 1,2,3,4

// merge arr with [3,4] and [5,6]
alert( arr.concat([3, 4], [5, 6])); // 1,2,3,4,5,6

// merge arr with [3,4], then add values 5 and 6
alert( arr.concat([3, 4], 5, 6)); // 1,2,3,4,5,6
Normally, it only copies elements from arrays (“spreads” them). Other objects, even if they look like arrays, added as a whole:

 let arr = [1, 2];

let arrayLike = {
  0: "something",
  length: 1
};

alert( arr.concat(arrayLike) ); // 1,2,[object Object]
//[1, 2, arrayLike]
…But if an array-like object has Symbol.isConcatSpreadable property, then its elements are added instead:

 





let arr = [1, 2];

let arrayLike = {
  0: "something",
  1: "else",
  [Symbol.isConcatSpreadable]: true,
  length: 2
};

alert( arr.concat(arrayLike) ); // 1,2,something,else

forEach:
Iterate: forEach
The arr.forEach method allows to run a function for every element of the array.

The syntax:

arr.forEach(function(item, index, array) {
  // ... do something with item
});

["Bilbo", "Gandalf", "Nazgul"].forEach((item, index, array) => {
  alert(`${item} is at index ${index} in ${array}`);
});

Searching using indexOf, lastIndexOf, includes

indexOf --> searches the item in the array if found retrns index else returns -1
lastIndexOf --> searches from R->L 
includes returns true if the item is included in the array else false
NOTE*** 
when searching for NAN includes is better because these search methods use === equality operator and it doesnt work ehn searching for Nan

var arr = [1,0,false];
arr.indexOf(0) //1
arr.indexOf(1) //0
arr.indexOf(false) //2  note it considers false as false only and not converts it to 0 becoz of the === equality .

arr.includes(false) //true
arr.indexOf(null) //-1

const arr = [NaN];
alert( arr.indexOf(NaN) ); // -1 (should be 0, but === equality doesn't work for NaN)
alert( arr.includes(NaN) );// true (correct)

find and findIndex

Whenn an array has multple objects and we want to find one obj with a specific condition then array.find method comes handy. it  returns true when the search is finished and returns that item. else it returns 
undefined.

var fig = [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "john"
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: "sam"
    },
    {
      id:3,
      name: "zoii"
    }
          ]
          
   var res = fig.find(item => item.id == 2)
   // res{id: 2, name: "sam"}
   
   findIndex also works the same way exceot for that it returns the index instead of the element itself
   and -1 if the item is not found.
   
   FILTER 
   The filter method looks for a single (first) element that makes the function return true.

If there may be many, we can use arr.filter(fn).

The syntax is similar to find, but filter continues to iterate for all array elements even if true is already returned:

let results = arr.filter(function(item, index, array) {
  // if true item is pushed to results and iteration continues
  // returns empty array for complete falsy scenario
});
For instance:

 let users = [
  {id: 1, name: "John"},
  {id: 2, name: "Pete"},
  {id: 3, name: "Mary"}
];

// returns array of the first two users
let someUsers = users.filter(item => item.id < 3);
