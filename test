To check wheater an obj is empty or not.
IN case of arrays it is convenient to check for the emptiness of it using the length property but in objects it is quite difficult as the objects
in jaavscript doesnt has any length property::

1)Code to check for the emptiness of object using hasOwnProperty

var obj = {};
function isEmpty(obj){
   for(let key in obj){
     if(obj.hasOwnProperty(key)){
       return false;                    // if object is not empty then it will return false
       } return true;                         //else it will return true
       }}
       
       isEmpty(obj)
       
       
       
2)Can you change the value of a const obj
Yes we can change the value of the const obj like we do for other primitive types. But if we try to reassign the entire object then it would throw 
an error that Assignment to const variable.

var obj={name: "naz"}
obj.name = "sam";   //this will work

but   obj = {name:"sam"}  //would throw error

3)
Sum object properties
importance: 5
We have an object storing salaries of our team:

let salaries = {
  John: 100,
  Ann: 160,
  Pete: 130
}
Write the code to sum all salaries and store in the variable sum. Should be 390 in the example above.

If salaries is empty, then the result must be 0.

Solution::

function sumOfSalaries(obj) {
   let totalSalary = 0;
    for(let key in obj){
       if(obj !== undefined && obj.hasOwnProperty(key)){
          totalSalary+=obj[key];
          } else{
          totalSalary = 0;
          }
          }
          return totalSalary;
          }
  sumOfSalaries(salaries)
  
  
  Multiply numeric properties by 2 and leavev the strings. This function should not return anything only modify the existing object in its place.
  SOLUTION
  
  function newMenu1(obj){
    let menu1 = obj;
    for(let key in menu1){
       if(typeof(menu1[key]) === "number"){
          menu1[key]*=2;
       }
    }
}
var menu9 = {
  width: 200,
  height: 300,
  title: "My menu"
};
newMenu1(menu9)

menu9
