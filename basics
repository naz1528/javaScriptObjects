JavaScript Object creation:

In JavaScript. Six of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).
In contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities.

Using literal or using obj constructor

ex: 
var obj = {}   or var obj = new Object()

Assigning data to obj
  var obj = {
     name: "John",
     age: 9
    }
  
Adding property to it 
   obj.country = "England"
  
Deleting property
   delete obj.age;
   
Adding multi word property using quotes
  obj["like birds"] = true;
