If one objects has two references then comparing both the refernces using the equality operator gives true because both are in the same address 
location in the memory.

var obj = {
name: "john"
}
var obj1 = obj // creating refernce of actual object

(obj == obj1)  and (obj === obj1)  //gives true 

However, two different objects which are empty gives false because they are in different locations in the memory.
let a = {};
let b = {}; // two independent objects

alert( a == b ); // false

Declaring objects as const allows you to add / modify objects

const obj = {
  name: "naz"
  }
  
  obj.age = 90;
