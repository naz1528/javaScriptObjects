Shorthand object property

function(name,age){
return {
name : name,
age : age
}
The above way of accesing the property is so common that there is a shorthand property itself that has been declared:

ex:
function(name,age){
return {
name,
age
}

To check wheater a property exists in javascript object we can use as :
1) check the property using strict equls operator
   if("key" === undefined) return false;

2) ("key" in obj)

var  obj = {}
 if("name" in obj){return true}
 
 Note**
 
If a certain property doesnt exist in javascript objects then it doent throws error instead it gives undefined.

*** Usually the strict equals gives the correct result except ina case where the value of an objecr is itself undefined in the declaration.
In such cases using in is the most proper result.
