Computed properties
We can use square brackets in an object literal. That’s called computed properties.

ex::
var fruits= promp("Enter a fruit name", "apple")

var obj = {
  [fruits] = 5
  }
  
  alert(obj.apple)
  
  
The meaning of a computed property is simple: [fruit] means that the property name should be taken from fruit.

So, if a visitor enters "apple", obj will become {apple: 5}.

Essentially, that works the same as:

 let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};

// take property name from the fruit variable
bag[fruit] = 5;


We can use more complex expressions inside square brackets:

let fruit = 'apple';
let bag = {
  [fruit + 'Computers']: 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5
};



NOTE****
Reserved words are allowed as property names
A variable cannot have a name equal to one of language-reserved words like “for”, “let”, “return” etc.

But for an object property, there’s no such restriction. Any name is fine:

 let obj = {
  for: 1,
  let: 2,
  return: 3
};

alert( obj.for + obj.let + obj.return );
